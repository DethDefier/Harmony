Harmony
A game for Blinks by Move38

In Harmony, each blink is assigned a different element.
Elements have different interactions with each other (Ex: water can't be next to fire).
The goal of Harmony is to have the most amount of points by having the most faces of blinks 'in harmony'.

A face of a blink is happy if it is
-Next to a blink face of it's own element
-Next to a blink face it doesn't particularly disagree with
Blink faces that are happy will slowly flash between white and their element.

A face of a blink is angry if it is next to a blink face of an opposing type.
Blink faces that are angry will rapidly flash between off and their element.

A face of a blink is neutral if it is not next to another face.
Blink faces that are neutral will stay one solid color.

The elements and disagreements between them are as follows:

Water (blue), fire (red), plants (green), rocks (orange), and lightning (yellow).

-Water cannot be next to fire or lightning
-Fire cannot be next to plants or water
-Plants cannot be next to rocks or fire
-Rocks cannot be next to lightning or plants
-Lightning cannot be next to water or rocks.

A happy face is worth 1 point
A neutral face is worth 0 points
An angry face is worth -1 point
