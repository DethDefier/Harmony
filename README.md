Harmony
A game for Blinks by Move38

In Harmony, each blink is assigned a different element.
Elements have different interactions with each other (Ex: water can't be next to fire).
The goal of Harmony is to make all blinks happy (or "in harmony").

A face of a blink is happy if it is
-Next to a blink face of it's own element
-Not next to a blink face
-Next to a blink face it doesn't particularly disagree with
Blink faces that are happy will slowly flash between white and their element.

A face of a blink is angry if it is next to a blink face of an opposing type.
Blink faces that are angry will rapidly flash between off and their element.

The elements and disagreements between them are as follows:

Water (blue), fire (red), plants (green), rocks (orange), and lightning (yellow).

-Water cannot be next to fire or lightning
-Fire cannot be next to plants or water
-Plants cannot be next to rocks or fire
-Rocks cannot be next to lightning or plants
-Lightning cannot be next to water or rocks.

Double click any blink in the cluster to give all blinks a new element.
Triple click any blink in the cluster to turn all blinks into 'challenge mode'.

In Challenge Mode:
Blink faces are angry if they are next to a blink face of their type.
